   <h1>Rabbi Ovadia Yosef</h1>
<p>
    Born in Baghdad, the eldest son of Jacob (son of Ovadia) and Georgia. His parents were cousins. Named 'Ovadia' after Rabbi Abdullah Somch and his grandfather, and 'Yosef' after Rabbi Yosef Chaim (the "son of Ish Chai"). His father's surname was Ovadia, and he later became his second first name by his surname[3][4]. In 1924[5], when he was four years old, his family immigrated to Eretz Israel and settled in the Beit Yisrael neighborhood of Jerusalem, where he made a living from his father's grocery store (in Iraq, his father worked as a jeweler).
